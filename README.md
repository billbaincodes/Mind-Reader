# 2023 Update

Sadly, IBM has discontinued their Tone Analyzer API, thus rendering the Mind Reader powerless. Stay tuned for a potential update using [Watson Natural Language Processing](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/watson-nlp.html?context=cpdaas). Leaving the site deployed for now for posterity.
